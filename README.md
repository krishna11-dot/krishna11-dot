Hi there, I'm Krishna 👋
Who am I?
I'm an AI and machine learning enthusiast with a fresh MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Aberdeen. Currently gaining hands on experience through my AI Residency at Apziva and Data Science Internship at XenoSilicon, but I'm actively seeking my first full-time role in this exciting field!
🚀 What I'm passionate about
I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to solve real world problems. My journey so far has taken me through:

Building ML models that actually work beyond the classroom
Exploring the fascinating world of agentic AI systems
Seeing computer vision applications come to life
Learning how LLMs can transform businesses

🔍 What I'm looking for
I'm on the hunt for entry-level opportunities in:

ML/AI Engineering
Data Science
Generative AI/Agentic AI Development

🌱 Current learning journey

Deep diving into Agents and reinforcement learning algorithms.
Experimenting with prompt engineering techniques.
Constantly refining my Python skills with a focus on ML libraries like PyTorch and scikit-learn, while implementing various ML algorithms from scratch to understand their inner workings.
Getting lost in Lex Fridman podcasts (currently obsessed with his conversations on AI alignment!)

📚 When I'm not coding...

Playing football (still waiting for my Premier League call up).
Hiking and exploring new trails (the aberdeenshire trail were incredible!).
Getting lost in thought while listening to tech and philosophy podcasts.
Trying (and often failing) to explain what I do to my non-tech friends

🤝 Let's connect!
I'm always up for interesting conversations about AI, ethics & Law in technology, or just sharing learning resources. Feel free to reach out if you're working on something cool or have advice for someone starting in the field!
