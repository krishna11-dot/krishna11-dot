Hi there, I'm Krishna 👋
Who am I?
I'm an AI and machine learning enthusiast with a fresh MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Aberdeen. Currently gaining hands on experience through my AI Residency at Apziva and Data Science Internship at Linen Labs Inc, but I'm actively seeking my first full-time role in this exciting field!

Currently building another POC besides Supply Chain agentic POC for my internship that uses NeuTTS Air for voice cloning and Wav2Lip to sync lips in videos. Works great for front-facing shots, but I discovered Wav2Lip struggles with profile/sideways faces where the lip sync ends up in the wrong position. Now figuring out how to handle different face orientations, which is turning into an interesting computer vision challenge!

🚀 What I'm passionate about
I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to solve real world problems. My journey so far has taken me through:

Building ML models that actually work beyond the classroom as There's a big gap between "it works on my laptop" and "it works in production." I'm obsessed with bridging that gap.
Exploring the fascinating world of agentic AI systems Autonomous agents that can actually do things? Sign me up.
Seeing computer vision applications come to life - There's something magical about teaching computers to see.
Learning how LLMs can transform businesses - We're still figuring out what's possible here, and that's exciting.

🔍 What I'm looking for
I'm on the hunt for entry-level opportunities in:

ML/AI Engineering
Data Science
Generative AI/Agentic AI Development

🌱 Current learning journey

Deep diving into Agents and reinforcement learning algorithms.
Experimenting with prompt engineering techniques(LLMs are weird and wonderful).
Constantly refining my Python skills with a focus on ML libraries like PyTorch and scikit-learn.
Implementing various ML algorithms from scratch to understand their inner workings (there's no substitute for building it yourself)
Getting lost in Dwarkesh Patel and Lex Fridman podcasts.
Random research papers that lead me down rabbit holes at 2 AM.
The open-source ML community (y'all are amazing).

📚 When I'm not coding...

Playing football (still waiting for my Premier League call up).
Hiking and exploring new trails (the aberdeenshire trail were incredible!).
Getting lost in thought while listening to tech and philosophy podcasts.
🤔 Pondering questions like "what does AI alignment even mean?" over coffee
😅 Trying (and often failing) to explain what I do to my non-tech friends

"So you teach computers to think?"
"Not exactly..."
15 minutes later
"So... you teach computers to think?"
"Close enough."

🤝 Let's connect!
I'm always up for interesting conversations about AI, ethics & Law in technology, or just sharing learning resources. Feel free to reach out if you're working on something cool or have advice for someone starting in the field!
