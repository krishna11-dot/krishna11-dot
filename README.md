Hi there, I'm Krishna 👋
Who am I?
I'm an AI and machine learning enthusiast with a fresh MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Aberdeen. Currently gaining hands on experience through my AI Residency at Apziva and Data Science Internship at XenoSilicon, but I'm actively seeking my first full-time role in this exciting field!
🚀 What I'm passionate about
I'm fascinated by the potential of AI to solve real world problems. My journey so far has taken me through:

Building ML models that actually work beyond the classroom
Exploring the fascinating world of agentic AI systems
Seeing computer vision applications come to life
Learning how LLMs can transform businesses

🔍 What I'm looking for
I'm on the hunt for entry-level opportunities in:

AI/ML Engineering
Data Science
Generative AI/Agentic AI Development

🌱 Current learning journey

Deep diving into reinforcement learning algorithms
Experimenting with prompt engineering techniques
Building my own mini-projects to test new ideas
Constantly refining my Python skills
Getting lost in Lex Fridman podcasts (currently obsessed with his conversations on AI alignment!)

💻 Projects I've enjoyed working on
MonReader: My first serious foray into computer vision - taught me that threshold tuning is both an art and a science!
Multi-Agent Systems: Discovered that making AI agents cooperate is surprisingly similar to managing group projects in university.
Bank Marketing Prediction: Where I learned that feature engineering is often more important than model selection.
📚 When I'm not coding...

Playing football (still waiting for my Premier League call up)
Hiking and exploring new trails (the Scottish Highlands were incredible!)
Getting lost in thought while listening to tech and philosophy podcasts
Trying (and often failing) to explain what I do to my non-tech friends

🤝 Let's connect!
I'm always up for interesting conversations about AI, ethics & Law in technology, or just sharing learning resources. Feel free to reach out if you're working on something cool or have advice for someone starting in the field!
